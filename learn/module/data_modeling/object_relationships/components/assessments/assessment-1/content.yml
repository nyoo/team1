  title: Create relationships for the Offer object
  description: "The object you created for the previous challenge is pretty handy.
    Imagine how much more useful it would be if brokers could specify which client
    made an offer and which property the client wants to buy. Add two relationships
    to the Offer object so brokers can capture this data in Salesforce. Create a Master-Detail
    relationship with the Property object and a Lookup relationship with the Contact
    object.\r\n<p>\r\n<br/>\r\n<b>Before You Start:</b>\r\n<ul><li>Create the <b>Property</b>
    object as described in the previous unit.</li></ul>\r\n<br/>\r\n<b>Challenge Requirements:</b>"
  requirements:
  - On the Offer object, add a <strong>Master-Detail</strong> relationship to the
    Property object named <strong>Property</strong>
  - On the Offer object, add a <strong>Lookup</strong> relationship to the Contact
    object named <strong>Contact</strong>
